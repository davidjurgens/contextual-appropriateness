If I buy a seaplane are you going to tell me I can't compare its ability to fly to other planes because, while it does fly like the other planes, *this one* is a *totally different vehicle* because 1 function was added on top of it?\n",
      "0.03\tThis was a case though where the matchup was kind of niche, saying they are at the top of a tournement so they should know every single interaction for every board scernio is absurd and to game loss someone for thag is even more ridiculous \n",
      "0.03\tCould you possibly imagine having a game you like and not being able to identify with the character through their only defining trait - gender? I can't imagine anyone who has ever had that particular problem.\\n\\nAlso, how would you feel if you had to connect with a character based on something absurd like personality, temperament, history, or - god forbid - game mechanics? What if you did manage to connect with a character through one of those tertiary characteristics and it happened to be a woman? Would you just be trans then? Because, obviously, if you relate to a person of another gender you automatically take on that gender.\n",

      "0.03\tAll I can say is it's very very hard to take the Russian media by its word, when the Russian media is state owned and most definitely has a pro-Russian propaganda bias. Is it possible this was a noble issue that Russia wanted to be heroic? Sure. Is it possible there was a bad situation and Russia decided to benefit from it? That's possible too. I take everything from Russia's news with a grain of salt.\\n\\nRomney, of all people, realized Russia was expanding its influence in a Cold War manner. Obama didn't listen, he was passive and Russia benefited from it.\n",

Have to return and of course re-order the Beyonds, then supposed to call and they will eventually credit to match the old price (40%). TRASH\n",
      "0.03\tnone of that crap makes a difference tbh, active pvpers is 3k, and alot of them are casual at best with less than 200 kills for the life of their pilots. Its fluffed up numbers that really doesn't matter.    \\n2 years ago goons would fill 2 full fleets and a third for overflow, a year ago they started to get 3 full and fourth of crap. This year they average 2 full and third of random shit on max hype fleets.   \\nNothing has changed except their number of in actives and non pvp pilots has gone up.      \\nThey still are scared to commit to big fights where they might lose and they still refuse to use their super cap fleet anywhere near pl or nc. They just sit in delve now and crab, while their fcs scrap together fleets for everyday content that is usually just bullshit ganking ratters. They wont deploy to fight anyone because their bots and input broadcasters would be vulnerable and they need that tax money\n",

      "0.03\tI thought Marauder needed to be nerfed, but not the nerf they handed down.\\n\\nMy thought process was that the only thing holding it down was a combination of Dwarves, NG spies and spy abuse in general.\\n\\nOnce that was taken away there was very little which could compete with it's tempo(except maybe consume which has a lot more counters), it was so easy in the last patch to get 20+ points without any real effort due to Bear Masters.\\n\\nWith that said it's ability was cool and should have remained so, i don't agree with the millions of 1 point nerfs but i think here it would have sufficed. \\n\\nNot only does it simplify the ability to be utterly boring like most things in Gwent right now it quite frankly took a revolver to the head of the card's viability at the same time.\n",
      "0.03\tLook man, I'm not trying to be a dick here, but your wife sounds like a close-minded and selfish bitch who's ready to take a swing at your dignity and guilt trip the crap out of you whenever you do something she deems as possibly mildly inconvenient to her- in this case, \"inconvenient\" being \"a husband who has the nerve to not share her gross food addiction.\" That's only taking into account the vegan thing.\\n\\nBut when you add in the religion (I assume she is still religious) and other things, it sounds like you guys are just growing apart and the vegan thing was just the last straw. This is obviously a stranger looking through a tiny, online window, but that's the impression this post gives. The compatibility may be fading if either of you is growing in a direction which the other is unable or unwilling to support. \\n\\nYou said you dont want advice on divorce but unless you added that after seeing such responses, the fact that you felt the need to even mention it is kinda telling. And when youre telling us that your wife is aggressively and persistently unsupportive of what you want to do *for yourself*, to the point where she enjoys seeing you fail because it means she gets the convenience of not having to deal with it anymore, then it's kinda hard for us to not allude to reconsidering the relationship. Just something to think about, and to discuss with her after you've had a chance to organize your own thoughts. Not saying \"get divorced,\" but you definitely need to talk to each other and acknowledge that things have changed, and decide together how to handle that.\n",
